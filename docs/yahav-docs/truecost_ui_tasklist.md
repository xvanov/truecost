# TrueCost — Frontend UI Task List (Developer 1)

_Frontend‑Only Workstream · Based on PRD, Product Brief, Architecture, and Design Spec_

---

# **Task 0 — Codebase Analysis & UI Scope Verification (Cursor Agent)**

**Purpose:** Ensure the existing codebase aligns with the new design spec and updated PRD.

### **Instructions for Cursor Agent:**

- Analyze the entire codebase.
- Identify components, pages, and styles that must be modified to match the new design system.
- Compare current routes to new required routes.
- Identify any missing screens that must be created based on:
  - PRD
  - Product Brief
  - Architecture doc
  - Final Design Spec
- Evaluate whether component abstraction is needed (buttons, cards, glass panels, navbars).
- Output a list of discrepancies and recommendations.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- A markdown report generated by Cursor summarizing: missing pages, extra pages, outdated components, routing changes needed, and UI inconsistencies.

---

# **Task 1 — Implement New Route Structure**

**Changes Required (be explicit, no backend work):**

- Create public and authenticated layout shells; ProtectedRoute wraps only private routes.
- Update `/` to be the public Landing Page.
- Move existing dashboard to `/dashboard` (auth-protected).
- Add new routes with placeholders (non-crashing, titled): `/estimate/new`, `/estimate/:id`, `/estimate/:id/plan`, `/estimate/:id/final`, `/account`.
- Add default redirect for unknown paths to `/`.
- Decide handling for legacy `/projects/:id/*` (redirect, sandbox, or deprecate) to prevent UX conflict during transition.
- Ensure nav links and CTAs point to the new routes.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Navigating to `/` displays the new Landing Page (public).
- `/dashboard` loads the current dashboard content behind auth.
- New routes render placeholders with page titles; no 404s.
- Legacy `/projects/:id/*` behavior is explicitly resolved (documented redirect/sandbox).
- Unknown paths redirect to `/` without loops.

# **Task 2 — Build Global Layout & Theme System**

**Purpose:** Establish universal design foundations.

### Subtasks (theme + layout bootstrap):

- Create theme file with:
  - Color tokens: background primary/surface, accent cyan/teal, glass border/background, text primary/secondary, danger.
  - Typography: IBM Plex Sans for headings, SF Pro Text for body; optional IBM Plex Serif accent. Define sizes/line heights for H1–Body.
  - Effects: borders, glows, blur settings for glass; radii and shadows; focus-visible styles.
  - Spacing scale: section spacing, card padding, page gutters (desktop/tablet/mobile).
- Implement layout spacing system (spacious density) via shared layout components/wrappers.
- Add global CSS reset + font declarations (IBM Plex Sans + SF Pro) and load fonts once.
- Apply theme via a shared app layout so all pages inherit tokens consistently.
- Define responsive breakpoints and container widths for landing vs. app shell.
- Provide helper classes/utilities for glass surfaces, pills, and accent glows.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- App visually switches to dark industrial neon aesthetic using shared tokens (no page-specific overrides needed).
- Typography matches serif-sans hybrid system with correct line heights/weights.
- All pages inherit the same spacing, colors, and typography through the shared layout.
- Glass tokens (bg/border/blur/glow) are reusable via utilities/components; no duplicated custom CSS.

---

# **Implementation Notes (applies to Tasks 5–13)**

- UI may rely on mocked frontend stores/hooks (`useEstimateStore`, `usePipelineStatus`, `useCadUpload`, `useVoiceInput`) to unblock screens without backend changes.
- Keep backend untouched; stubs/mock data are acceptable for UI completion.
