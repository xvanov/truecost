# TrueCost - Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

### The Problem

Construction contractors face a fundamental business challenge: **estimation accuracy directly impacts profitability**. A 5% estimation error on a $1M project = $50K lost profit.

Current estimation methods suffer from:
- **Manual takeoff**: Time-consuming measurement extraction from drawings
- **Single-point estimates**: No understanding of uncertainty or risk
- **No learning**: Errors repeat across projects
- **Inconsistency**: Different estimators, different results

### The Magic Moment

> A contractor uploads their CAD plan and describes the project scope via text or voice, and within minutes receives a comprehensive, professionally-formatted estimate with cost breakdown, timeline, risk analysis, and confidence intervals—all automatically extracted from the plan and calculated.

## How It Should Work

### User Journey

1. **Input Section**
   - Upload CAD plan (PDF, DWG, or image) - **mandatory**
   - Describe project via text or voice in central chatbox
   - Clarification Agent asks follow-up questions for missing details
   - Review extracted project brief

2. **Plan Section**
   - View extracted measurements from CAD
   - Review scope breakdown by CSI division
   - Can discuss modifications with agent
   - Verify and adjust before proceeding

3. **Final Estimate Section**
   - Summary card: total cost, timeline, confidence range (P50/P80/P90)
   - Expandable detailed breakdowns
   - Editable line items
   - Download professional PDF
